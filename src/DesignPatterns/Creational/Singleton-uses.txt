When to use the singleton pattern?#
The singleton pattern is mostly used in cases where you want a single object to coordinate actions across a system. Singletons are mostly used by:

Services: services can be singleton since they store the state, configuration, and provide access to resources. Therefore, it makes sense to have a single instance of a service in an application.

Databases: when it comes to database connections, databases such as MongoDB utilize the singleton pattern.

Configurations: if there is an object with a specific configuration, you don’t need a new instance every time that configuration object is needed.
