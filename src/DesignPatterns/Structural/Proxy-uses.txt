The proxy pattern tries to reduce the workload on the target object. You can use it when dealing with heavy applications that perform a lot of network requests. Since delays could occur when responding to such requests, using a proxy pattern will allow the target object to not get overburdened with requests.

A real-life example is HTTP requests. These are expensive operations, therefore, the proxy pattern helps in reducing the number of requests forwarded to the target.
